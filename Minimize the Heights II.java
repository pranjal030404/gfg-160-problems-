// Given an array arr[] denoting heights of N towers and a positive integer K.

// For each tower, you must perform exactly one of the following operations exactly once.

// Increase the height of the tower by K
// Decrease the height of the tower by K
// Find out the minimum possible difference between the height of the shortest and tallest towers after you have modified each tower.

// You can find a slight modification of the problem here.
// Note: It is compulsory to increase or decrease the height by K for each tower. After the operation, the resultant array should not contain any negative integers.

        int n = arr.length;
        int r = arr[n - 1] - arr[0];

        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
